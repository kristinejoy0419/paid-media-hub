# Paid Media Hub

Turns a GTM strategy doc into a paid media plan: a bill of materials (BOM), a creative spec sheet, a line-by-line agency trafficking and tagging sheet, and monthly flighting. It builds Low, Medium and High versions of each, plus a side-by-side comparison.

It opens pre-filled with a **proxy** worked example: an illustrative, outside-in lead-gen plan for Rubrik, built only from public information. Its budgets, KPIs, timing and proof points are assumptions, not Rubrik's real plan or results.

## Run it

It's a static site with no build step.

- **Locally:** open `index.html` in a browser.
- **GitHub Pages:** go to *Settings → Pages*, set *Source* to "Deploy from a branch", then choose `main` and `/ (root)`. The site will be served at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Inputs (left rail)

1. **GTM brief:** campaign name, product, and the doc text. You can paste it or upload a `.pdf`/`.docx`/`.txt`, then use "Fill inputs from doc" to set markets and channels. The **AI agent** panel connects your own Google Gemini key (free tier available from Google AI Studio) or Anthropic API key so an agent reads the brief, and reads uploaded PDFs whole (tables, charts and scanned pages included).
2. **Budget & flight:** a budget for each version, plus flight dates.
3. **Markets:** weight %, budget $ (for the selected version) and language for each market. Edit % or $ and the other updates.
4. **Audiences:** decision-maker, technical influencer and day-to-day user, plus any audiences you add in the blank row.
5. **Initiatives & pillars:** pulled from the GTM doc (blank if it names none), each with a funnel stage and message pillar. Placements use the initiative that matches their stage.
6. **Launch moments:** key milestones from the GTM doc (blank if none), which drive the monthly bursts.
7. **Channels:** turn each on or off and set its weight or its budget $. L/M/H shows the first version a channel appears in.
8. **Creative volume:** concepts per placement and refresh cadence for each version.
9. **Creative units:** every ad unit, grouped by platform (search, display, LinkedIn, Meta, X, Reddit, YouTube, WeChat, publishers, creators, events) with its specs. Ticked units feed the Spec Sheet and BOM. Also sets the video cut-down lengths.
10. **Messaging & ad copy:** voice, headlines and body copy per initiative, CTAs and proof points.

## Outputs (tabs)

| Tab | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | Totals, budget by channel, market, initiative and funnel stage, and the assumptions used |
| BOM (MVP) | The minimum creative set. Each master (one per format and aspect ratio) has click-to-edit ad copy with character counters (red when over), the media lines it covers, platform resizes and file counts |
| Line items | One row per channel × placement × market, with targeting, buy type, rate, budget, estimated delivery, KPI and BOM items |
| Spec Sheet for Creative | Sizes, file types, max sizes, copy limits and lead times for each ad unit in the plan |
| Flighting & Projected Outcomes | Monthly spend per channel with launch and event bursts, projected outcomes by month, and KPIs and outcomes by channel |
| Buy Details | Every buy in the selected version: buy type, editable rate vs benchmark, budget, delivery, markets and KPI |
| Spec & Trafficking Sheet for Agency | A trafficking row for every line (BOM items, files, ad copy that follows BOM edits, pixel, ad name, UTMs and tracked URL), plus pixel and conversion setup for each channel |

Exports: an `.xlsx` for the current version, one `.xlsx` with all versions, a CSV of the current tab, or "Copy table" to paste into Sheets.

## Notes

- Rates are 2026 B2B planning benchmarks, not quotes. Override them on the Rates tab.
- Specs marked "Confirm" vary by platform or publisher. Check the current spec before production.
- When the page runs as a claude.ai Artifact, "Fill inputs from doc" and "Draft copy with Claude" use the built-in Claude on your Claude account (no key needed). PDFs are sent as text plus page images, so charts, tables and scanned pages are read too. On the standalone site, connect an AI agent (a Gemini or Anthropic API key, saved only in your browser and sent only to that provider). Gemini's free tier has daily limits, and Google may use free-tier prompts to improve its products for the same features plus full-PDF reading. With no agent, "Fill inputs from doc" falls back to a keyword scan and you write the copy by hand.
- Inputs are saved in your browser's localStorage. Use "Reload example" to reset, or "Start blank" to clear everything.

## Files

- `index.html`: page structure and inputs
- `styles.css`: theme tokens (light and dark) and layout
- `app.js`: the channel, placement and spec library, plan engine, rendering and exports
